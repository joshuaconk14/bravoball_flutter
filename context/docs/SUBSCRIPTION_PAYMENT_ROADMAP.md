# Subscription Payment Implementation Roadmap

**Created**: August 15, 2025  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Target Completion**: Q4 2025  
**Maintainer**: Development Team  

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing subscription payments in the BravoBall Flutter app. The implementation follows industry best practices and accommodates both iOS and Android platforms while maintaining the existing premium system architecture.

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: In-App Purchase Setup & Dependencies
**Timeline**: Week 1-2  
**Priority**: Critical

#### 1.1 Add Required Dependencies
- `in_app_purchase` - Flutter's official in-app purchase plugin
- `in_app_purchase_android` - Android-specific implementation  
- `in_app_purchase_storekit` - iOS-specific implementation

#### 1.2 Platform Configuration
- **iOS**: Configure App Store Connect with subscription products
- **Android**: Set up Google Play Console with subscription products
- **Web**: Prepare for web-based payment integration (optional)

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Dependencies added to `pubspec.yaml`
- [ ] iOS App Store Connect products configured
- [ ] Android Google Play Console products configured
- [ ] Product IDs documented and mapped

---

### Phase 2: Product Configuration & Store Setup
**Timeline**: Week 2-3  
**Priority**: Critical

#### 2.1 Product IDs Setup
- Create subscription products in both stores with matching IDs
- Example: `bravoball_monthly_premium`, `bravoball_yearly_premium`
- Ensure pricing matches `PremiumConfig` ($15/month, $95/year)

#### 2.2 Store Product Mapping
- Map `SubscriptionPlanDetails` to actual store products
- Handle different currencies and regional pricing
- Implement product availability checking

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Product IDs created in both stores
- [ ] Pricing configured and validated
- [ ] Product mapping service implemented
- [ ] Currency/regional pricing handled

---

### Phase 3: Purchase Flow Implementation
**Timeline**: Week 3-4  
**Priority**: High

#### 3.1 Purchase Service Architecture
- Create `PurchaseService` that wraps `in_app_purchase`
- Implement platform-agnostic purchase methods
- Handle purchase state management (pending, completed, failed)

#### 3.2 Purchase Flow Steps
```
User selects plan → Validate product availability → 
Initiate purchase → Handle platform dialogs → 
Process result → Update backend → Show success/error
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] `PurchaseService` class implemented
- [ ] Purchase flow UI states implemented
- [ ] Platform dialogs handled
- [ ] Purchase result processing

---

### Phase 4: Backend Integration & Receipt Validation
**Timeline**: Week 4-5  
**Priority**: High

#### 4.1 Receipt Validation
- Implement server-side receipt verification
- Use existing `PremiumConfig.receiptValidationRetryAttempts`
- Handle both iOS App Store receipts and Android purchase tokens

#### 4.2 Backend Purchase Endpoint
- Create `/api/premium/process-purchase` endpoint
- Validate receipts/tokens with Apple/Google
- Update user's premium status in database
- Return updated user status

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Receipt validation service implemented
- [ ] Backend purchase endpoint created
- [ ] Database update logic implemented
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic

---

### Phase 5: User Experience & Error Handling
**Timeline**: Week 5-6  
**Priority**: Medium

#### 5.1 Purchase States & UI
- Loading states during purchase
- Success confirmation with premium features unlocked
- Error handling with retry options
- Offline purchase queueing

#### 5.2 Post-Purchase Flow
- Immediate premium feature unlock
- Welcome premium user experience
- Email confirmation (optional)
- Premium status persistence

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Purchase state UI components
- [ ] Success/error handling flows
- [ ] Post-purchase user experience
- [ ] Offline purchase handling

## 🔒 Security & Production Considerations

### Receipt Validation Requirements
- **Never trust client-side data**
- **Always validate on your backend**
- **Use Apple/Google's official validation APIs**
- **Implement retry logic for failed validations**

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Network failures**: Queue purchases for retry
- **Store errors**: Show user-friendly messages
- **Validation failures**: Log for investigation
- **Partial failures**: Graceful degradation

### Security Measures
- **Receipt encryption**: Secure transmission to backend
- **Token validation**: Verify purchase authenticity
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse of purchase endpoints
- **Audit logging**: Track all purchase attempts

---

## 📱 Platform-Specific Requirements

### iOS (App Store)
- **Subscription Groups**: Required for subscription management
- **Price Points**: Use Apple's predefined price tiers
- **Receipt Validation**: Use App Store Server API (recommended) or local validation
- **Auto-renewal**: Handle subscription status changes
- **Sandbox Testing**: TestFlight deployment required

### Android (Google Play)
- **Billing Library**: Use latest version for subscription support
- **Purchase Tokens**: Validate with Google Play Developer API
- **Real-time Developer Notifications**: For subscription status updates
- **Grace Period**: Handle payment failures and grace periods
- **Internal Testing**: Alpha/Beta channel deployment

---

## 🎯 Implementation Priority Matrix
