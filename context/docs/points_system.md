i want to implement a points system with xp and treats, this is how it works:
XP: use case is for progress towards leaderboards. how to earn: through training and drill completion
treats: use case is streak saver, streak freezer, drill skippers, end session early, double XP. how to earn: refill treats:
50 treats: $5.99
100 treats: $9.99
200 treats: $19.99

streak saver = 25 treats
streak freezer = 15 treats

i want this to work similar to duolingos points and reards system a little bit, The user will be able to purchase a streak freeze (where they can freeze their streak for a day), and a streak recoverer where if they lose a streak, they can use the streak recoverer to get their streak back. we are only going to work on these features for now

later we will impelment the xp later on, as well as power-ups (for example, getting more xp for drills by using a power-up)
