# 🔒 Lock Screen Widget Guide - RunKeeper Style Timer

## 🚀 What's New

Your BravoBall app now has a **lock screen widget** that shows live timer countdown when your phone screen is off - just like RunKeeper's running timer! 

### ✨ Features
- **📱 Live Countdown**: See exact time remaining on lock screen
- **📊 Progress Bar**: Visual progress indicator 
- **⏸️ Pause/Resume**: Control timer from lock screen notification
- **🛑 Stop Button**: End timer from notification
- **🎵 Background Audio**: Timer continues running when app is closed
- **🔔 Completion Alerts**: Get notified when sets complete

## 🎯 How It Works

### **When You Start a Drill Timer:**
1. **Countdown Audio**: Hear 3-2-1 countdown sounds
2. **Lock Screen Widget Appears**: Persistent notification shows:
   - Drill name (e.g. "Ronaldinho drill to cone turn")
   - Time remaining (e.g. "04:32 remaining")
   - Progress percentage (e.g. "24% complete")
   - Pause/Resume and Stop buttons

### **Lock Your Phone:**
- ✅ Timer continues running in background
- ✅ Lock screen shows live countdown
- ✅ Progress bar updates in real-time
- ✅ Audio cues still play (countdown + completion)

### **From Lock Screen You Can:**
- **Pause/Resume**: Tap the pause button to pause timer
- **Stop Timer**: Tap stop to end the drill
- **See Progress**: Watch countdown and progress bar
- **Hear Completion**: Get audio + notification when set finishes

## 📱 Testing the Lock Screen Widget

### **Quick Test (30 seconds):**
1. **Start app** on physical device
2. **Go to drill follow along** 
3. **Start any drill timer**
4. **Immediately lock phone** 📱🔒
5. **Check lock screen** - should see timer widget
6. **Listen for audio** - countdown sounds should play
7. **Wait 30 seconds** 
8. **Unlock phone** - timer should still be running
9. **Try pause/resume** from notification

### **Expected Lock Screen Display:**
```
